The Python Calculator Project is a program that performs arithmetic and scientific computations. Using Python's capabilities, it can be implemented as a console-based or GUI-based application. Features typically include:
Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Advanced Functions: Square root, exponentiation, logarithm, and trigonometric calculations.
Error Handling: Ensures user-friendly responses to invalid inputs.
Customization: Easily extendable with additional mathematical functions.
This project demonstrates Python's versatility and is great for learning programming concepts, GUI development, and computational logic.

This Scientific Calculator is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application built using the tkinter library. It offers the following features:
Basic Arithmetic: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Scientific Functions: Includes square root (âˆš), sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan), logarithm (log), and power (x^y).
User-Friendly Interface: Buttons for numbers, operators, and functions arranged in a clean layout.
Error Handling: Displays appropriate error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero, invalid log).
Clear Button: Allows resetting the input field.
This calculator is ideal for solving basic to advanced mathematical expressions with ease.
